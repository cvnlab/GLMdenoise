GLMdenoise is a MATLAB toolbox for analyzing and denoising task-based fMRI data.
It is developed by Kendrick Kay (kendrick@post.harvard.edu).

To use the toolbox, add it to your MATLAB path:
  addpath('GLMdenoise');
  addpath('GLMdenoise/utilities');

To try the toolbox on an example dataset, change to the GLMdenoise directory 
and then type:
  example1;
This script will download the example dataset (if it has not already been
downloaded) and will run the toolbox on the dataset.
