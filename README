# GLMdenoise

GLMdenoise is a MATLAB toolbox for analyzing and denoising task-based fMRI data.
It is developed by Kendrick Kay (kendrick@post.harvard.edu).

To use the toolbox, add it to your MATLAB path:
  addpath(genpath('GLMdenoise'));

To try the toolbox on an example dataset, change to the GLMdenoise directory 
and then type:
  example1;
This script will download the example dataset (if it has not already been
downloaded) and will run the toolbox on the dataset.

History of major code changes:
- 2014/08/01:
    Version 1.4.
    - Add option for obtaining parametric GLM fits and error estimates.
    - Add new DVARS sanity-check figures.
    - Change the polynomial functions such that they are all mutually orthogonal
      and unit-length.  This may cause slight changes to behavior due to numerical
      precision issues.
- 2014/07/14:
    Version 1.31.
    - Minor fixes to improve platform compatibility.
    - Add additional input flexibility.
- 2013/12/13:
    Version 1.3.
    - Added new example scripts.
- 2013/11/18:
    Version 1.2.
    - The default canonical HRF has changed.  (It is now smoother/nicer than before.)
    - Add additional input flexibility.
    - If pcvoxels is determined to be empty (e.g. no voxels were above 0% for any number
      of PCs), we now issue a warning (instead of crashing) and fallback to simply using 
      the top 100 voxels to select the number of PCs.
    - Change the colormap scaling for the PCcrossvalidationscaled*.png figures.
    - Use fullfile to ensure compatibility with different platforms.
    - In GLMestimatemodel.m, we now use the same default for opt.maxpolydeg that is
      used in GLMdenoisedata.m (instead of defaulting to 2).
    - Various small tweaks.
- 2013/05/12:
    Version 1.1.
    - The experimental design can now be specified in terms of onset times.
      This means that conditions do not have to exactly coincide with the TRs.
    - Fixed a bug concerning extraregressors.
    - Additional optional inputs, additional outputs, and additional figures.
    - All-zero regressors (e.g. encountered via bootstrapping) are now assigned zero weight.
- 2012/12/03 - Version 1.02. Various speed-ups and minor bug fixes.
- 2012/11/24 - Version 1.0.
