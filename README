GLMdenoise is a MATLAB toolbox for analyzing and denoising task-based fMRI data.
It is developed by Kendrick Kay (kendrick@post.harvard.edu).

To use the toolbox, add it to your MATLAB path, change to the directory just above GLMdenoise and type
  addpath(genpath('GLMdenoise'));

To try the toolbox on an example dataset, change to the GLMdenoise directory 
and then type:
  example1;
This script will download the example dataset (if it has not already been
downloaded) and will run the toolbox on the dataset.

History of major code changes:
- 2013/05/12:
    Version 1.1.
    - The experimental design can now be specified in terms of onset times.
      This means that conditions do not have to exactly coincide with the TRs.
    - Fixed a bug concerning extraregressors.
    - Additional optional inputs, additional outputs, and additional figures.
    - All-zero regressors (e.g. encountered via bootstrapping) are now assigned zero weight.
- 2012/12/03 - Version 1.02. Various speed-ups and minor bug fixes.
- 2012/11/24 - Version 1.0.
